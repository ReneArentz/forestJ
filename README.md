This custom-built [forestJ Framework](https://forestany.net/fjava.php) in Java, developed in Eclipse, is designed to streamline the development of robust applications by providing a comprehensive suite of tools and interfaces.

It offers seamless integration with console applications, efficient file handling solutions, and database management capabilities. Additionally, the framework supports both FTP and SFTP protocols for secure file transfers, and includes advanced features for socket programming, enabling smooth communication across networks. By combining these functionalities, the framework simplifies complex tasks, threading, enhancing developer productivity and application performance.

Following **database systems** will be supported by forestJ:

* MariaDB/MySQL
* SQLite3
* MSSQL
* OracleDB
* PostgreSQL
* MongoDB

This framework is designed to be in sync with the corresponding *forestNET framework* in C#, ensuring both platforms offer the same functionality and capabilities. This alignment enables seamless interoperability between Java and .NET applications, allowing for smooth integration and consistent performance across diverse environments.

forestJ framework will be released under the **GPLv3 license** and the **MIT license**. Thus it is freely possible to use forestJ in other projects - projects with free software or in commercial projects.
